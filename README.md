# Implementation of Love-Letter Game in MERN Stack 

## Description: What is Love Letter?
All of the eligible young men (and many of the not-so-young) seek to woo the princess of Tempest. Unfortunately, she has locked herself in the palace, and you must rely on others to take your romantic letters to her. Will yours reach her first? <br /><br />
***Love Letter*** is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2 â€“ 4 players. Your goal is to get your love letter into Princess Annette's hands while deflecting the letters from competing suitors. From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!

- [Download and install node.js and npm](#download)

- [Open terminal and `cd` into cloned repo's directory](#open)
- [Install dependencies using `npm` node package manager](#dependencies)
- [Run the app on your machine](#run)


## Download and install node.js and npm
### Check if it's already installed
Firstly, if there is a chance of node.js and npm being already installed on your computer, check them by :
```
node --version
npm --version
```
So if these output you anything, like *v12.16.1* or *6.5.1*, it means you already have node.js installed on your machine.

If not, please do the below steps to install it properly.

### For Windows machines
If you have Windows as your OS, you can download and install node.js easily on
> https://nodejs.org/en/download/

make sure you choose **windows installer**.

### For Linux (Unix) machines
One of most ways to install node.js and npm in your linux machine, is to install it by [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager).We suggest you to do it this way as it is a practical tool for managing multiple Node.js versions. 
1. To install NVM, download the installation script from Github.For that, you will use the curl command line.
   - If you do not have `curl`, install it by running:
   
`sudo apt install curl`

   - Press **y** to confirm the installation and hit **Enter**
   
2. Now, download the NVM installation script with the command:
   `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash`
   - After it automatically clones the NVM repository and adds the NVM path to ZSH or Bash, you will receive the        following output:
